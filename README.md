Official app used for treasure hunt domain activity conducted by Fundaz a domain of Aaruush, SRM KTR
Event Description:

The Vatican Engine is a campus-wide treasure hunt inspired by the mysteries of the Order of the Quill, a secret brotherhood sworn to guard the lost manuscript known as the Codex Lux. The event merges ancient mystery storytelling with a modern app-based game system, transforming the entire campus into a living puzzle map.
The experience begins at the registration desk, where teams formally enter the hunt. Each team provides their details and is assigned a unique team code along with a route color. These codes and routes ensure structured gameplay and prevent overlap, allowing multiple teams to play simultaneously.
Once inducted, participants embark on a loop of riddle-solving, exploration, and verification, guided through the app and monitored by event admins in real-time.
The gameplay cycle works as follows:
Unique Team Code & Route Color Assign
Teams receive a team code (their unique identity) and a route color (their assigned hunt path). This ensures fair distribution across campus locations.
Photo Proof Submission
At each location, the team must take a group photo with the QR code visible in the background. This serves as evidence of their progress.
Admin Verification & Approval
The submitted photo is received instantly by admins. Once verified, approval is given, and the team is permitted to continue.
